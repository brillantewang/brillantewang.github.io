# TeacherPay - An analysis on teacher salaries to student outcomes across 35 countries

## Background and Overview
As a former teacher, I had heard a few times that countries that paid their teachers the highest salaries also had the best education systems.

This project will allow me to confirm if that is true by analyzing data provided by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). TeacherPay will be a simple and beautiful visual tool that shows the relationship between teacher pay and student performance outcomes on science, math, and reading across the 35 countries who are members of the OECD.
